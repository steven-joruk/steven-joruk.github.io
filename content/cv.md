## Profile

My love of programming began long before I knew it would be my career, but even now it takes up many of my free evenings. Problem solving is a constant source of enjoyment, which enables me to stay focused even when I'm challenged. I’m able to read through sparse documentation and legacy code effectively on my own, but don’t hesitate to ask for help. I value team productivity and sustainability highly, along with solving the right problems by having a deep understanding of my users' needs.
My ideal work place would value quality, have a similar level of enthusiasm, and would have a positive effect on the world - either through the products they create or their contributions to open source software.
